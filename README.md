# LRU Cache Simulation

A very naive and simple simulation of a [LRU Cache](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_algorithms#Least_Recently_Used). "Hits" are read immediately while "misses" are require a wait of 0.2 seconds to simulate disk or network latency.

## Building

    $ make lru-cache-simulation

## Running
    $ ./lru-cache-simulation
